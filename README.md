## My process
   I must say that the experience was both challenging and rewarding. While working on the project, I faced a few difficulties, particularly with JavaScript. I struggled with accessing the value in radio buttons. It took me longer than I expected.


Another hard part was styling the radio buttons. I discovered that they can't be styled by themselves, so I hide the element and used pseudo-element *:before* to create a button that can be styled.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Pseudo-elemnts

### What I learned

 - get data from forms with JS
 - Style radio buttons with pseudo elements
 - Style elements using JS
